Whats the flow?
is this script run on a timer?
can it be queue based where on mention, this script is run?
wheres this run? Azure function? heroku? Amazon lambda?

Ideally:
someone mentions twitter bot
Task runs that gets tweet info: submitter, tweet message, stripping out just the query
Compiler takes query and transforms into action to perform query against data source
Data returned is formatted to:
tweet back just text? - phase 1
how about an image of the stats, in table form; image is hosted and pasted as image url in tweet - phase 2

Companion site:
query directly in text field, stats are returned
is this also the player index app? - NO that is a mobile app or PWA. Something different

Platform Structure

twitter

---------------

twitter bot script
- transform could take query and convert to graphql query object!
- transform could take query and simply convert into JSON object similar to human readable
- shape of query is determined by the endpoint that platform exposes. This might be limiting...

---------------

Platform (REST Api)
- endpoint to accept player query, stat types, grouping?
- graphQl endpoint
- Really, really wanna use asp.net core for this. is graphql supported? How limiting would this be?
- PostgreSQL as data store...where appropriate...what do we store? What is page scraped? 
- Security token. each platform client will require a token to communicate directly with Api

First steps

API and client in conjunction so that we know the needs of our client
Hosting for both API and client twitter bot

Platform notes
Azure functions can be run based on cron jobs so web scraper for data fetching and stat updates could be done on a schedule...maybe once a day? or on specific days at midnight
